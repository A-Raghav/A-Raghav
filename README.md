# Hi, I’m Aseem 👋

**Data Scientist / ML–AI Engineer** in Dublin, building practical AI systems end-to-end — from retrieval and agentic reasoning to deployment and observability. Previously @ Innovaccer. I care about reliability, clear interfaces, and shipping useful tools.

## 🚀 What I’m building now
**StatsEye — a research assistant for Ireland’s CSO data**  
Hybrid retrieval + agentic Python analysis on CSO datasets, wrapped in a conversational UI (Chainlit), deployed on GCP (Cloud Run). Makes finding the *right* table and getting first insights a one-message job.

Designed to transform how researchers, analysts, and curious minds interact with statistical data available on [Data-CSO website](www.data.cso.ie). Try the [StatsEye-Assistant](https://statseye-assistant.com) now!

Tools and frameworks used:
- LangGraph (for agent orchestration)
- FAISS Vector DB (for storing vector embeddings)
- Gemini 2.5-flash (API) and Gemini embedding model
- Redis (for checkpointing and long-term memory storage)
- Chainlit (UI-wrapper on React front-end)
- Google Cloud Run (for deployment)
- Docker (for containerising)

## 📌 Focus areas
- Retrieval that actually retrieves (hybrid ranking, table/entity linking)
- Agentic workflows with safe tool-calling and review gates
- “First-5-minutes” insights: fast EDA, charts, and citations straight from chat
- Clean deployment paths (containers → Cloud Run/K8s) and observability
